GitHub Collaboration Guide

To maintain a smooth workflow for the team:

Do not work directly on main branch.

Always create a separate branch for your task or feature.

Example:

git checkout -b feature/header-section

Complete your task, test locally, and commit changes.

Push your branch to GitHub:

git push origin feature/header-section

Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into main.

Team lead or reviewer will approve the PR after code review.

Branching Strategy

main → always stable and deployable.

feature/* → individual features or sections.

bugfix/* → fixes for any bugs.

hotfix/* → urgent fixes for production.

Commit & Pull Request Rules

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

✅ Add responsive hero section

✅ Fix mobile menu alignment issue

Do not commit unfinished work directly to main.

Include a brief description in your PR explaining what changes were made.
